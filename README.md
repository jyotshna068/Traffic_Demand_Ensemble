# Gridlock — Traffic Demand Forecasting (Flipkart GRiD)

Ensemble learning solution built for the Flipkart GRiD hackathon. The notebook (`Gridlock.ipynb`) predicts road traffic demand per location (geohash) and time slot by combining gradient-boosted tree models into an ensemble, rather than relying on a single estimator.

---

## 🔗 Problem Statement

Given road-level and environmental attributes (location, road type, number of lanes, large vehicle presence, landmarks, weather, temperature) at a given day and timestamp, predict **demand** — the traffic load for that geohash at that time.

---

## Model Architecture

### 1. Feature Engineering

- **Temporal features:** timestamp (`H:MM`) parsed into `hour`, `minute`, `time_in_minutes`; cyclic encoding via `hour_sin` / `hour_cos`; day-of-week proxy (`day_mod7`) with `day_sin` / `day_cos` cyclic encoding.

- **Spatial / geohash features:** per-geohash aggregate demand stats (`mean`, `median`, `std`, `count`) computed on train and joined into both train/test; geohash truncated to 3/4/5-character prefixes to capture demand at multiple spatial resolutions, label-encoded.

- **Spatio-temporal interaction:** average demand per (`geohash`, `hour`) pair (`geo_hour_mean`), backfilled with the geohash-level mean for unseen combinations.

- **Categorical handling:** `RoadType`, `LargeVehicles`, `Landmarks`, `Weather` filled with `"Unknown"` / `"missing"` and either label-encoded (for LightGBM/XGBoost) or passed natively as categoricals (for CatBoost).

- **Numeric cleanup:** `Temperature` missing values imputed using the median temperature per `Weather` type (falling back to global median).

---

### 2. Train/Validation Split

A **chronological split**, not a random one: records from `day == 49` at or after **1:30 AM** are held out as the validation set, with everything before that as training. This mimics forecasting into the future rather than leaking nearby timestamps into validation.

---

### 3. Base Models

Three gradient-boosting regressors are trained independently:

| Model | Library | Key Config |
|-------|---------|------------|
| **CatBoost** | `CatBoostRegressor` | `iterations=1000`, `lr=0.05`, `depth=6`, RMSE loss, native categorical features, early stopping (50 rounds) |
| **LightGBM** | `LGBMRegressor` | `objective='regression_l1'` (MAE), `n_estimators=1000`, `lr=0.05`, `num_leaves=31`, `subsample/colsample=0.8`, L1/L2 regularization, early stopping |
| **XGBoost** | `XGBRegressor` | `objective='reg:squarederror'`, `n_estimators=1000`, `lr=0.05`, `max_depth=6`, `subsample/colsample=0.8`, early stopping |

CatBoost additionally goes through a **GridSearchCV** hyperparameter sweep (`iterations`, `learning_rate`, `depth`) with 3-fold CV on RMSE.

All models predict non-negative demand via

```python
np.clip(preds, 0, None)
```

---

### 4. Model Selection & Ensembling

We trained and evaluated three boosted-tree models — **CatBoost**, **LightGBM**, and **XGBoost** — before deciding on the final ensemble.

#### Why CatBoost was left out of the final ensemble

CatBoost was trained on a smaller feature set (`minutes`, `NumberofLanes`, `Temperature`, the geo-level demand stats, and the raw categoricals) and didn't include the richer engineered signals:

- cyclic time encoding (`hour_sin/hour_cos`, `day_sin/day_cos`)
- `geo_hour_mean` spatio-temporal interaction
- multi-resolution geohash prefixes (3/4/5-character)

that LightGBM and XGBoost were given.

Even after a dedicated **GridSearchCV** hyperparameter sweep, CatBoost's validation RMSE/MAE/R² came in weaker than the other two models on the held-out chronological split, so it was kept as a benchmark/comparison run rather than folded into the final blend.

#### Why LightGBM + XGBoost were ensembled

Both were trained on the identical, fuller feature set, so their errors are driven by genuinely different model mechanics rather than missing information.

- LightGBM was tuned with an **MAE objective** (`regression_l1`)
- XGBoost used a **squared-error objective**

so they tend to make different kinds of mistakes on the same rows.

Averaging the two smooths out model-specific noise/variance without needing a learned meta-model, and the validation metrics for the blend came out more stable than either model alone.

```python
ensemble_prediction = (lightgbm_prediction + xgboost_prediction) / 2
```

This is applied to both the validation set (for scoring) and the test set (for the final submission).

---

### 5. Evaluation

Each model — and the final ensemble — is scored on RMSE, MAE, and R² against the chronological validation split.

---

### 6. Output

The final blended predictions are generated for the competition test set and exported as a submission file ready for Flipkart GRiD evaluation.
